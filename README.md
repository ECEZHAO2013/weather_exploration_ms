# 🌦️ Weather Chronicles: Unveiling the Stories Behind the Skies

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that transforms raw meteorological data into compelling narratives about our changing climate.

## 📖 The Story
Every data point tells a story—a record-breaking heatwave, a surprisingly dry spring, or the subtle shift in seasonal patterns over decades. This project goes beyond simple charts to answer: *How is our local environment actually changing, and what does that mean for the way we live?*

## 🚀 Key Insights
*   **[Insight 1]:** e.g., "The 'Missing' Winter: How average February temperatures have risen by 4°C since 1990."
*   **[Insight 2]:** e.g., "Predicting the Puddle: A correlation analysis between humidity peaks and flash flood events."
*   **[Insight 3]:** e.g., "Golden Hours: Identifying the specific shifts in sunset visibility over the last decade."
